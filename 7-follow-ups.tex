\section{Follow-ups}
\label{sec:follow-up}

The presented taxonomy serves as a glossary of terms and techniques useful in the discussions that arise around \eid{} projects. It is the first step in the comprehensive understanding of what exists and what is possible. 

To complete the systematization of knowledge, a set of \emph{evaluation criteria} will be applied to higher order constructions such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Longfellow-zk \cite{FS24}, a recent publication and implementation for zero-knowledge proofs based on mDoc signed using ECDSA
    \item zk-attest \cite{zkattest-rs}, a proposal that blinds ECDSA signatures using a conveniently designed curve (TOM-256)
    \item Crescent \cite{FFL25} adds "privacy features" to JWT and mDL credentials
\end{itemize}

As well as complete system proposals in Switzerland and the EU:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Swiyu \cite{Swiyu} -- the current \eid{} proposal in Switzerland
    \item the ARF \cite{EUDI-ARF} -- the reference for the European Digital Identity project
\end{itemize}
