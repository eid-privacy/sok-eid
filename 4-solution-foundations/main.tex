\subsection{\sfi}
\label{sub:foundations}

This section lists \emph{existing} constructs such as \emph{cryptographic primitives}, \emph{hardware security}, \emph{data structures}, and \emph{communication protocols} (for a later release) related to digital identity systems.
%Together, they make up a set of tools that we will consider when building a proposal for the \eid.
