# Systematization of Knowledge for e-ID

This is the first part of our SoK on e-ID.
The second part will include the evaluation metrics, and apply them on the EU and CH e-ID systems.

## LaTeX it

We propose that you [install devbox](https://www.jetify.com/docs/devbox/installing_devbox/), and then run:

```bash
devbox run pdflatex
```

To create the pdf.
